# SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction
**Author:** Christopher Varghese

## Overview
For any business, especially services that are subscription based, it is important to maximize customer retention. The goal of this project was to predict if a customer was soon to churn by analyzing the data associated with customers that left or stayed with the service. Wether or not a customer would churn was expressed as a binary classification where the prediction would yield True if the customer was soon to churn and False if they weren't.

## Business and Data Understanding
Detecting if a customer is soon to churn can definitely increase customer retention rates provided there is a strategy to actually prevent them from churning. This may include offering them a promotion or exploring why they are churning and who they are seeking service from next.

The data is collected from SyriaTel, a telecom company. It was obtained as a csv file of 3,333 rows and 21(5 categorical and 16 numeric) columns. The column 'Churn' was isolated as the target where it was found to be True if the customer left and False if they stayed. The data was processed and the relationships between the features were examined while modelling.

Categorical variables where encoded to numerical values for the modeling process. Dataframe was checked for null values and other imperfections.
